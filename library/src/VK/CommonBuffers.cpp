	// The temp old buffer should be null after a copy is done
	// and it has been destroyed. If it is at the beginning and the old buffer didn't have any
	// data, just moving wouldn't be an issue. But once it has some data, if we try to increase
	// the buffer size twice, it will move the old buffer with the data to the tempbuffer, but
	// if the GPU copy hasn't been done before it is increased again, the old tempBuffer will
	// be replaced with a new empty one and all data will be lost.
	// But this check should fix everything in theory. As, if we are recreating the main buffer
	// multiple times, the new old buffer would be empty as the gpu copy wouldn't have been done yet.
	// So, we wouldn't need to copy it. And since the first old buffer will be stored in the temp
	// buffer, it won't be null and so we wouldn't replace it and the data should be preserved and
	// safely copied to the main buffer upon calling CopyOldBuffer next.
	// Also no need to copy if the main buffer doesn't exist.

	// To add, if the buffer is increased twice in the beginning, before a copy is made, the
	// old temp buffer will be empty. And so we have to copy the old buffer first on the gpu.
	// Checking if that range is copied would also work, but this should only happen once, so
	// one empty copy should be fine.
